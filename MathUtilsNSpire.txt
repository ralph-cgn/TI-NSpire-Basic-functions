MathUtils 0.1 for TI NSpire CAS
(c) Ralph Schenn 2011 (rschenn@t-online.de)

This library was inspired by the following books:

Kemnitz: "Mathematik zum Studienbeginn"
...: "Elektronik..."

It does not include any documentation beyond the comments contained in the functions. 

Because i have switched to the TI 89 i will not continue to develop it. 

The library for the TI 89 does not provide exactly the same functionality of this library but is already more pwerfull than this one. 

The names of folders, functions and paramters are partly in german - sorry for the inconvenience this causes for international readers. 

In contrast to the library for the TI 89 this library does not require addional libraries.
